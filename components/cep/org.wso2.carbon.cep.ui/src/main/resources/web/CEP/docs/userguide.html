<h1>Complex Event Processing Server - Buckets</h1>

<h2>Deployed Buckets</h2>

<p><img alt="" src="../images/deployed_buckets.png"/></p>

<p>Figure 1: Deployed Buckets</p>

<p> Complex Event Processing server's deployed buckets page shows you a table of all the available buckets in the server.
    You can have three operations on available buckets in this page.The three basic features provided in this page are;
    "Removing Bucket" and "Viewing a bucket" and "Edit Bucket". You can delete multiple buckets at once by checking the
    check box against each bucket and clicking on delete button.
</p>


<ul>
    <li>View Bucket</li>
        <p>Once you click on the bucket name in Deployed buckets page , You will be directed to this page.</p>

        <p><img alt="" src="../images/view_bucket.png"/></p>

        <p>Figure 2: View Bucket</p>

       <p> Here you can find all the information on the bucket like, name, description, engine provider, inputs, queries.
       In order to edit the bucket , there is a link 'Edit Bucket' in the top left corner of this page. When you click on
       that, you will be directed to 'Edit Bucket page'</p>

    <li>Edit Bucket</li>
       <p>Once you click on the "Edit Bucket" link on deployed buckets page, you will be directed to this page.</p>

        <p><img alt="" src="../images/edit_bucket.png"/></p>

         <p>Figure 3: Edit Bucket</p>

        <p> Here you can find all the information on the bucket like, name, description, engine provider, inputs, queries.
            You can remove the existing inputs and queries of the bucket and add new inputs and queries to the bucket from
            this page. But changing the basic information like "Bucket Name" , "Descriptions" and "Engine provider" is
            not allowed with this version. Once you have finished removing and adding inputs and queries, click on "Save"
            button and it will save to the modification to the bucket.
        </p>

    <li>Delete Bucket</li>
     <p>Once you click on "Delete" link after checking out the check box in "Deployed Bucket" you will be asked for the
         confirmation. when you confirm the delete operation , it will remove the bucket from the server.</p>

        <p><img alt="" src="../images/delete_bucket.png"/></p>

         <p>Figure 4: Delete Bucket</p>
</ul>

<h2>Add Bucket</h2>

<p><img alt="" src="../images/add_bucket.png"/></p>

<p>Figure 5: Add Bucket</p>

    <p> Once you click on the 'Add' menu item under 'CEP Buckets' Sub menu in left panel, you will be directed to
         Add Bucket page. Adding bucket to the server can be done in tree states.</p>


     <li>Adding Basic Information</li>

        <p> Here you can provide the name of the bucket , Description for the bucket (Optional) and choose the
         Engine provider that you are going to use for the bucket. Once you click on 'Save' , this information
         will be saved in the server and you can add inputs and queries to the bucket by editing the bucket.
        </p>

    <li> Adding Basic Information and Inputs</li>

        <p> Other than the above basic information, you can add inputs to the bucket and save the bucket.</p>

     <li>Adding Basic Information, Inputs and Queries</li>

       <p> In this state you are adding all the required information for the bucket.</p>

     <p>You can find more information about the bucket in the User guide of CEP.</p>

     <h3>Add Input</h3>
        <p>Complex Event Processing Server is triggered by events. When some event source publish event or stream
            of events , there should be a topic to publish the events to be received by the CEP Server. By defining
            inputs, we are defining a topic where an event source can publish to. An input consists of five main elements
         </p>

        <p><img alt="" src="../images/add_input.png"/></p>

            <p>Figure 6: Add Input</p>
            <li>Topic</li>
                 <p>Topic which an event source should publish events to be received by the CEP Server </p>

            <li>Broker Name</li>
                <p>Name of the broker in which, events are used to send through. You need to create a broker if any thing
                 is not listed in this drop down. To create a broker , Click on 'Add' menu item under Broker sub menu which
                    exists under 'Configure' menu in left panel </p>

            <li>Mapping Stream</li>
                 <p>Name of the stream of the events </p>

             <li>Xpath Definitions</li>
                 <p>Xpath of the receiving xml elements to be mapped </p>

             <li>Properties</li>
                 <p>Properties to be extracted from the receiving xml element </p>

        <p>Once you provide the above information and click on 'Add Input' button, it will listed in the inputs table and
           you will be able to see  details of the topic once you click on the input name listed in the table. If you have added
           wrong values you can simply delete the input from the table by selecting the check bix provided for the
           particular input and click on delete button.
        </p>
        <p> NOTE : Inputs will not be save to the server until you click on the 'Save' button for the bucket.</p>

      <h3>Add Query</h3>
        <p>Filtering and triggering new events on received events is the basic idea of the CEP Server. To filter events
            there should be some criteria specified in the CEP Engine. This criteria which is needed to filter events is
            provided with the query of the CEP Bucket. There can be one or more queries and user can decide the number of
            queries required to perform the expected task.
         </p>

        <p><img alt="" src="../images/add_query.png"/></p>

        <p>Figure 7: Add Query</p>

         <p>Query consists of three elements.</p>
            <li>Query Name</li>
                 <p>Name of the query which is used to identify </p>
            <li>Expression</li>
                 <p>Actual query text contains in the expression, This can be inlined or can be browsed from registry </p>
                    <li>Inlined </li> <p>User can type the query in the provided space</p>
                    <li>Registry </li>
                        <p>
                        User can browse the registry by clicking on the provided registry browser and
                        select the query expression from registry.(Before browsing the registry to get this from the registry
                        , user needs to store the query in registry)</p>
             <li>Output</li>
                 <p>When an event is triggered or filtered from the input events, that event need to be publish to a topic
                     to be received by another event listener. In configuring output we are providing the topic which the
                     new event to be published and the format of the output event. </p>

                  <p><img alt="" src="../images/add_query_output.png"/></p>

                    <p>Figure 8: Add Output</p>

                <p> User has to provide three things when defining an output</p>
                  <li>Topic</li>
                        <p>Topic which a filtered event should be published. Any one interested in receiving filtered events
                            need to be subscribed to this topic </p>
                  <li>Broker name</li>
                        <p>Name of the broker in which, events are used to send through. You need to create a broker if any thing
                 is not listed in this drop down. To create a broker , Click on 'Add' menu item under Broker sub menu which
                    exists under 'Configure' menu in left panel </p>

                  <li>XML Mapping</li>
                        <p> User can provide the full output xml element to be fired. When there are required fields to be filled
                            with filtered values, names of those values should be provided within curly brackets and CEP Server
                            will identify them and replace with the filtered values </p>
                 <li>Element Mapping</li>
                    <p>User can create the format of the output xml element by providing properties and their types.</p>
                <p>Note: After filling all the required fields of the Query , click on add query button to add Query to the bucket.
                    Once you clicked it will disappear the query form and added query will be appeared in Queries table.</p>

                <p>Note: As the last step of adding a bucket , click on save button. Once you clicked it will redirect to the
                    deployed buckets page and deployed bucket will be appeared in buckets table. Further to check whether you
                    have entered the details correctly you can click on the link with the defined bucket and it will show added
                    details. You can come back to the previous adding bucket page by clicking on the back button provided or if
                    needed to edit the bucket you can click on the "Edit" link on the top of the View bucket Page. </p>
