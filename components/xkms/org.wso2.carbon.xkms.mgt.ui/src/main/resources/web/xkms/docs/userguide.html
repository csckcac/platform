<h1>XKMS Implementation and Configurations</h1>


<p>WSO2 Carbon ships with an in built XKMS trust web service which is being built on top of XKMS
   specification and consists of 5 services which can be used to simplify key management. Following
   is an description about the implementation and configuration of XKMS trust web service.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>XML Key Management Service Specification (a.k.a. XKMS) defines a standard way of
generating key pairs, storing public key information and retrieving public
key information. The XKMS services can be exposed as Web services which allow
other applications to delegate some of the key information processing to such
services. That allows the client applications of XKMS services to operate
without worrying about the Public Key Infrastructure which the XKMS services
might be using. XKMS consists of two components. Namely:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Protocol Exchanges
        <br/>

        Consist of sequences of request/response pairs. This will focus on synchronous,
        asynchronous
        and two-phase request protocols.
    </li>
    <li>Key Information Service (X-KISS)
        This set of services allows the client application to retrieve information
        about a public key. This has the following operations,
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Locate</li>
            <li>Validate</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Key Registration Service. (X-KRISS)
        This set of services allows the client application to register the public
        key of a client generated key-pair, retrieve the private key of a
        server generated key-pair, revoke a registered public key and recover
        a private key issued by the server. This has the following operations,
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Register</li>
            <li>Reissue</li>
            <li>Revoke</li>
            <li>Recover</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Implementation</strong></h3>

<p>WS02 XKMS Implementation allows the users to expose a Java key store via the following
   XKMS operations.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Registration of a Key Pair</strong><br/>


        This allows the client to register a public key with the XKMS service.
        The XKMS service uses the metadata specified in
        the Register request to a X509Certificate using the given public key
        and stores it in underlying Java keystore
        as a X509Certificate. If a public key is not specified in the
        Register request, the server will generate a RSA
        key pair and will send the private key back to the client in an encrypted block.

        Please refer to XKMS sample to see how to use an XKMS client to register a public
        key with an XKMS server.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reissueing of a X509Certificate</strong><br/>


        This allows the client to reissue a X509Certificate with new credentials specified
        in Reissue request. For example, the client may request the server to reissue a
        X509Certificate with a new validity interval. However the
        specified credentials are only advisory to the service.

        Please refer to XKMS sample to see how to use a XKMS client to send a reissue
        request to a XKMS Service.

    </li>
    <li><strong>Recovering a Key Pair</strong><br/>


        This allows the client to recover the key (and the private key for server-generated
        key pairs)
        if it is lost. The private key will be presented inside an encrypted bock.

        Please refer to XKMS sample to see how to use a XKMS client to send a recover
        request
        to a XKMS service.

    </li>
    <li><strong>Locating a Public Key / X509Certificate</strong><br/>


        This allows the client to use a XKMS service to locate a Public key or
        X509Certificate.
        The XKMS service may reply with
        more than one Public keys or X509Certificates if the query has multiple matches.
        the client may use the alias
        of the key as the key name in the query.

        Please refer to XKMS sample to see how to use a XKMS client to send a locate request
        to a XKMS service.

    </li>
    <li><strong>Validating a Public key or a X509Certificate</strong><br/>


        This allows the client to validate a Public key or a X509Certificate using the XKMS
        service.
        The XKMS service will
        reply whether the Public key or the X509Certificate is trustworthy.

        Please refer to XKMS sample to see how to use a XKMS client to send a validate
        request to the
        XKMS service.

    </li>
</ul>
<a name="configuration"></a>

<h3><strong>Configuration</strong></h3>
<p>The XKMS service can be configured by editing the following parameters for the service as
shown in figure 1.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>
        Server authentication code</strong><br/>

        Specifies the authentication code used to authenticate client requests.
    </li>
    <li><strong>
        Key store location</strong><br/>

        Specifies the location of the Java keystore to be used as the key store of XKMS
        service.
    </li>
    <li><strong>
        Key store password</strong><br/>

        Specifies the password of the above keystore.
    </li>
    <li><strong>
        Server certificate alias</strong><br/>

        Specifies the alias of XKMS server certificate. This will be used to sign
        entire outgoing XKMS messages.
    </li>
    <li><strong>
        Server key password</strong><br/>

        Specifies the private key password of the service. This will be used to sign
        entire outgoing XKMS messages.
    </li>
    <li><strong>
        Issuer certificate alias</strong><br/>

        Specifies the alias of the the Issuer certificate which will be used as
        issuer certificate when generating
        certificates for public keys specified in Register requests.
    </li>
    <li><strong>
        Issuer key password</strong><br/>

        Specifies the password of Issuer private key. This will be used when generating
        certificates for public keys
        specified in Register requests.
    </li>

    <li><strong>
        Default expiration interval</strong><br/>

        Specifies the default validity interval of generated certificates. Client can
        request to
        limit the validity
        period to a value less than the default but can not increase it more than the
        default period.
    </li>
    <li><strong>
        Default private key password</strong><br/>

        Specifies the password to be used to store server-generated private keys.
    </li>
    <li><strong>
        Enable persistence</strong><br/>

        Sets the flag to enable persistence. If set, it will persist the Java keystore when
        the
        keys are uploaded.
    </li>
